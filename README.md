# Smart Health Care

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

To develop the Android Application, we are used Flutter an open source Framework, and 
dart language for Designing and developing the application. For the backend, we use the 
“Firebase” Real-time Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and 
sync data between your users in real-time. For developing the function of skin diseases 
detection, we are used “Google Colab” as a Platform and python as a programing language 
also include CNN to develop the algorithm to detect skin disease detection. This project is 
divided into two major parts:
 1) Symptoms check 

            for Symptoms Checker we used flutter and dart language to design the UI
            and we retrive information of that disease from “Firebase”

 2) skin Disease detection

            For Disease Detection we used flutter and Dart language to design the UI
            we implement out CNN model in flutter with the help of TensorFlow LITE.
    
## Acknowledgements

 At the initial phase of the disease, people avoid going to the hospital because either 
at the initial phase of the disease they don't take it seriously or due to social anxiety they 
want to hide their problems.

 Either they don't want to go to the hospital because it is a very 
lengthy process like they have to take appointment so this process takes time . 

To make this process easy, free, and get a quick solution. The proposed 
android application takes disease-related symptoms information from the user and after 
processing the information they get appropriate information about the disease. The main objective of this application is to provide the right information about 
the diseases information to the user in the initial phase of the disease
